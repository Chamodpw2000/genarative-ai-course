Ollama is an open-source tool that allows you to run large language models (LLMs) locally on your computer. 
It provides a simple interface to download, manage, and interact with various AI models without needing cloud access. 
Ollama is popular for its ease of use, privacy (since data stays on your device), and support for multiple models, 
making it useful for developers and AI enthusiasts who want to experiment with LLMs on their own hardware.
