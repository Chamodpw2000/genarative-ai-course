LLMs come in 3 flavors:

1. Base Models
   - These are the foundational models trained on vast amounts of text data.
   - Examples include GPT-3, BERT, and RoBERTa.
   - They can be fine-tuned for specific tasks but are not specialized out of the box.
2. Chat/Instruct:
    - These models are fine-tuned versions of base models designed to follow instructions or engage in conversational tasks.
    - Examples include InstructGPT and ChatGPT.
    - They are optimized for generating human-like responses and understanding user prompts.
    - Better for interactive use cases and creative content generation.

3. Reasoning/Thinking:
    - These models are further specialized to perform complex reasoning tasks.
    - Examples include models like GPT-4 with enhanced reasoning capabilities.
    - They excel in tasks that require logical thinking, problem-solving, and multi-step reasoning.
    - Ideal for applications in education, research, and decision-making support.


✨ Other that these models we have Hybrid Models that combine features from Chat/Instruct and Reasoning/Thinking categories to cater to specific use cases.
✨ Budget forcing is decide between Chat/Instruct and Reasoning/Thinking models based on the complexity of tasks and required performance. It is essential
to evaluate the specific needs of the application to choose the right model type.
✨ In summary, the choice between Base Models, Chat/Instruct, and Reasoning/Thinking models depends on the specific requirements of the application, including
the complexity of tasks, desired interaction style, and performance needs.
